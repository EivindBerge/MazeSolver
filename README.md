# MazeSolver
Small recursive GUI-application that finds the way out of a maze. Written in Java.

File names, variable names and function names are all in Norwegian, but the application works by simply compiling the .java files and running the MazeSolver executable. This opens a file chooser dialog box. The .in files contain mazes, choose one of them. (Number 5 and 6 are the biggest ones). When the GUI is loaded, click one of the squares. The program finds a way out! (if there is one..)
