# MazeSolver
Small recursive GUI-application that finds the way out of a maze. Written in Java.

File names, variable names and function names are all in Norwegian, but the application works by simply compiling and running the MazeSolver executable. This opens a file chooser dialog box. The .in files contain mazes, choose one of them. When the GUI is loaded, click one of the squares. The program finds a way out! (if there is one..)
